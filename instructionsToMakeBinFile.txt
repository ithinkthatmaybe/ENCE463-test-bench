This file contains instructions to setup CCS to build a .bin file.
The .bin file is required by "LM Flash Programmer" in order to
program the Stellaris.

====STEP ONE====
Properties --> Build --> Steps tab
under Post-build steps, paste: 
"${CCE_INSTALL_ROOT}/utils/tiobj2bin/tiobj2bin" "${BuildArtifactFileName}" "${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin" "${CG_TOOL_ROOT}/bin/ofd470" "${CG_TOOL_ROOT}/bin/hex470" "${CCE_INSTALL_ROOT}/utils/tiobj2bin/mkhex4bin"




====STEP TWO====
You may need to add resources to CCS if they are not there already.
For example, SW_ROOT was not already there for me.

Properties --> Linked Resources --> Path Variables tab
add new:
NAME: SW_ROOT
LOCATION: ${ORIGINAL_PROJECT_ROOT}\..\..\..\..
