Main.c
	- Provides a test manager that recieves commands from python and initiates tests.


Test.c
	- Provides tasks that perform and monitor individual tests. Provides startup and shutdown tasks for 
	  each test that configure stellaris peripherals before test and disable them after a test is complete



uut_gpio.c
	- ISRs and Utility functions for GPIO operations on the UUT
		- pulse generation and response isrs for airspeed and transponder testing

			PWM is used to generate stimulus for the uut, and GPIO triggered interrupts are used 
			to monitor UUT response. Latency is measured using the stopwatch structure from
			the stopwatch module. A stopwatch is started on the rising edge of the PWM output
			and is subsequently stopped when a rising edge from the uut indicates that it has 
			entered it's own response ISR. 

	- utility functions enable the reseting of the UUT, which is done on system startup.
