ESTR_GPIO:

System primarily works around uut_gpio.c, the uut_gpio_init() sets up gpio data direction etc before registering 
the airspeed response interrupt and registering an airspeed stimulus task that performs the test. 

The stopwatch module is used to measure response times. one stopwatch instance is used, it is started in the 
RTOS airspeed task and stopped in the response interupt. A flag (g_airspeed_response_flag) is also set in the task 
and reset in the interrupt. This is used to check 1:1 respose.  

It is expected that the structure of this body will change significantly.
