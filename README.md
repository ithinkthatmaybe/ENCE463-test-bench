Code for the ENCE 463 test rig project


The development plan for the project is as follows:

Two seperate incarnations of the code will be developed seperately, ESTR_GPIO & ESTR_UART. These seperately impliment the two subclasses of required tests.
These are not being developed in sepearte branches for the sake of simplicity. Code branching will however be used for the contorolled implimentation of new features. 

The first iteration of working code will use hardware display and control for performing tests and displaying resutls, though this will eventually be replaced with a python operated controller.
