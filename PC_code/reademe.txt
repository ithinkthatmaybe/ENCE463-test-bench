The PC code is written in Python 2.7.

To run the program, run "deliverable3.py". Instructions are
on the screen. This program loads tests on to the Stellaris
by using "LM Flash Programmer" from Texas Instruments. This
loads the .bin files located in "testBins". At the moment,
test1.bin is the UART test, and test2.bin is the GPIO test.

These .bin files must be copied from the "Debug" folder 
generated by Code Composer Studio.

Currently there is no UART support for deliverable three.
